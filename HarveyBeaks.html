   	 <h1>Why I Love Harvey Beaks? - Richard Fitzwell</h1>
    
    	<p>Hello there! I'm Richard Fitzwell, and today, I'm going to explore the most underrated Nickelodeon show to ever exist - Harvey Beaks.

        <p>When people first think of Nickelodeon, people will think of the likes of Spongebob Squarepants or Fairly Oddparents.
			While those shows were both successful in their own rights and the fact that Nickelodeon has quite popular hits within their
			vaults, one such show seems to had slipped under the rug and forgotten to time. That show was Harvey Beaks.<br><br>

			Airing in March 2015, the plot involves the titular character, Harvey, as he goes on adventures and having fun with his two best friends (who are twins),
			Fee and Foo, where mischief becomes a usual result within their home Littlebark Grove. The show was created by a man named C.H. Greenblatt,
			who worked on other shows, such as Chowder, the Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Spongebob Squarepants.<br><br>

			The show was well recieved, but despite the good reception, it lasted for only 2 seasons before cancellation due to poor viewingship,
			which led to the last few episodes of season 2 of Harvey Beaks to be aired on Nicktoons instead of Nickelodeon, before finally ending in December 2017.
			<br><br>
			
			To me, this show is beautiful as it manages to capture the essence of childhood and adventure, accompained by such amazing animation.
			The characters we follow are all interesting - Harvey is a tame character and his foils, Fee and Foo, are mischievious which usually
			creates the situations and adventures Harvey gets himself into. The humor is great and doesn't devolve into being mean-spirited. The
			casting were spot on, as during the time, the main characters (who were kids) were played by kid actors, making their perfomances
			believable and entertaining. For a show that came out in 2015 (where at that point Nickelodeon was relying on Spongebob to make money,
			while having failures such as the notorious Breadwinners crap), Harvey Beaks felt like pure fresh air and gave something interesting to watch.
			Overall, Harvey Beaks is an underrated gem, that's been an unfortunate victim to poor viewingship, causing Nickelodeon to plug the plug
			out from the show. Here's hoping that it will get more recognition on streaming services for what it has offered.
			<br><br>

			Thank you for reading this - Richard Fitzwell.
